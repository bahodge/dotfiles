# dotfiles

This is a dangerous operation that will override your .zshrc file. If you value whatever you have, make sure you back it up before running the install.sh script. I Should also mention that this script will change your terminal from the default to zsh. To run `./install.sh`. This does not include any of my work dependencies but is instead used to setup a new machine for me.

## Ubuntu 20.04

This will execute a series of child scripts and get your machine setup

```sh
./scripts/install.sh
```
